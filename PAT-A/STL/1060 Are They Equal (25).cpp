/**
 If a machine can save only 3 significant digits, the float numbers 12300 and 12358.9 are considered equal since they are both saved as 0.123×10
​5
​​  with simple chopping. Now given the number of significant digits on a machine and two float numbers, you are supposed to tell if they are treated equal in that machine.

Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case which gives three numbers N, A and B, where N (<100) is the number of significant digits, and A and B are the two float numbers to be compared. Each float number is non-negative, no greater than 10
​100
​​ , and that its total digit number is less than 100.

Output Specification:
For each test case, print in a line YES if the two numbers are treated equal, and then the number in the standard form 0.d[1]...d[N]*10^k (d[1]>0 unless the number is 0); or NO if they are not treated equal, and then the two numbers in their standard form. All the terms must be separated by a space, with no extra space at the end of a line.

Note: Simple chopping is assumed without rounding.

Sample Input 1:
3 12300 12358.9
Sample Output 1:
YES 0.123*10^5
Sample Input 2:

Sample Output 2:
NO 0.120*10^3 0.128*10^3
