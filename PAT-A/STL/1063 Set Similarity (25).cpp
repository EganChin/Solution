/**
 Given two sets of integers, the similarity of the sets is defined to be N
​c
​​ /N
​t
​​ ×100%, where N
​c
​​  is the number of distinct common numbers shared by the two sets, and N
​t
​​  is the total number of distinct numbers in the two sets. Your job is to calculate the similarity of any given pair of sets.

Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case. Each case first gives a positive integer N (≤50) which is the total number of sets. Then N lines follow, each gives a set with a positive M (≤10
​4
​​ ) and followed by M integers in the range [0,10
​9
​​ ]. After the input of sets, a positive integer K (≤2000) is given, followed by K lines of queries. Each query gives a pair of set numbers (the sets are numbered from 1 to N). All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

Output Specification:
For each query, print in one line the similarity of the sets, in the percentage form accurate up to 1 decimal place.

Sample Input:
3
3 99 87 101
4 87 101 5 87
7 99 101 18 5 135 18 99
2
1 2
1 3
Sample Output:
50.0%
33.3%
